#  neighborhood matrix svd analysis
 The code reads a dataset, constructs a neighborhood matrix based on source-destination relationships, computes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) using both NumPy and SciPy, verifies the accuracy of these SVD implementations against a manual SVD computation, and visualizes the eigenvalues to analyze the data's structural properties.
